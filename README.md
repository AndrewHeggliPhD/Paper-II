# Paper II - Carcase grading reflects the variation in beef yield â€“ a multivariate method for exploring the relationship between beef yield and carcase traits

## Abstract
Beef carcases in Europe are classified as a proxy for the quantity and ratio of tissues, commonly referred to as yield. It is important that proxies accurately measure yield as they contribute to financial transactions between abattoirs and producers. The main purpose of the study was therefore to examine the ability of EUROP carcase classification to explain the variation in yield. Furthermore, the effect of breed, as a confounder, was also examined. A multivariate definition of yield separating the carcase into six product categories was utilised as a response in a linear regression analysis. The conclusion was that EUROP and carcase features explain the majority of yield variation. Breed has an effect on yield beyond what is explained by carcase features including classification. The magnitude of the breed effects varies with breed and product category.
